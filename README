stuff to do:

 - make an admin page to add comics and stuff (use passport!)
 
 - ask israel how he wants it styled, and what extra features to add.
 
 - add dates to the model and individual comics :)
 
 -deal with urls for comics that don't exist :p
 
 -make controllers or whatever is necessary to take all the logic out of the routes file, ALSO organize your routes and views into 
    files that make sense
    
-add to github

- add CSRF security to the admin page, and creat an admin login with encrypted password

 -add MongoStore before this goes live!!!!!!!
